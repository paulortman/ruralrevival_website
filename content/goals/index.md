We have broadly defined three goals.

### Development of a local food system

_**Rural Revival**_ will work:

  1. with local food producers in the production, preservation, processing, and marketing of food;
  2. with consumers of the area in locating sources for local food products;
  3. with retail outlets in the development of local markets for locally produced food.

### Transfer of land to aspiring farmers

_**Rural Revival**_ will work to set up a program linking those who have land or resources available for aspiring farmers with those aspiring farmers themselves. _Rural Revival_ will work with individuals and congregations seeking help in the transfer of land from one generation to the next.

### Educational/informational programs

_**Rural Revival**_ will seek to plan public programs for churches and community organizations providing education and information on topics within the group&#8217;s primary interests â€” local food and land tenure issues. The group will work to shape an ethically informed stewardship of land, community and resources.
