South Dakota&#8217;s agriculture secretary says new rules covering the
production, testing and labeling of raw milk sold in the state will take effect
Dec. 11.

The Agriculture Department had been trying to pass the [rules][1] since last
spring and has held three hearings on the issue. The Legislature&#8217;s Rules
Review Committee approved the changes earlier this month.
