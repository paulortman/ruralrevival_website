BROOKINGS, SD -- SDSU Extension regional centers in Sioux Falls and Watertown will host soil health educational
[forums][1] next month.

The SD's Soil Health Challenge: _Don't Get Left in The Dust_ events will feature information on soil organic matter,
weeds, cover crops and wet soils. Each will also feature a panel of farmers who will share some tips on what has, and
what has not, worked on their farms.
