BROOKINGS, SD &#8211; SDSU Extension regional centers in

Sioux Falls and Watertown will host soil health educational [forums][1] next month.

The &#8220;SD&#8217;s Soil Health Challenge: Don&#8217;t Get Left in The
Dust&#8221; events will feature information on soil organic matter, weeds, cover
crops and wet soils. Each will also feature a panel of farmers who will share
some tips on what has, and what has not, worked on their farms.
