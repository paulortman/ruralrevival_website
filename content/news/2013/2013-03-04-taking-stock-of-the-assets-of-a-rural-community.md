Historically, rural communities like ours here in Freeman have experienced a
decided disadvantage within the dominant urban cultures where they have lived.
While urban centers depend on rural communities for their food, fiber and the
raw materials of urban life, their numbers, wealth and power far outstrip those
of rural communities. Rural communities typically live under the shadow of the
“metropolis,” which literally means “mothercity.” Decisions affecting life in
rural communities are often made not by rural residents, but by government
bureaucrats, corporate boards, and elite specialists centered in the city.
Governments, corporations and universities, all institutional expressions of
urban power, all too often dictate decision making in rural communities.

All this is ironic, given the fact that the city depends directly on the
countryside for its very life. One would think that would give rural communities
some leverage! It is ironic as well because in fact, rural communities possess
unique assets that could and should enable them to hold their own against the
urban powers in which they live. Rural sociologists speak of these assets in
terms of different forms of capital that are present, sometimes uniquely, within
rural communities. These types of capital are:

* Cultural capital—the values, heritage, and ways of life represented in the
  community;
* Human capital—the skills and abilities of each person within the community;
* Social capital—the networks, norms of reciprocity, and mutual trust within and
  among the groups comprising the community;
* Financial capital—the money available to be used for investment in the
  community;
* Built capital—the infrastructure and institutions available within the
  community;
* Natural capital—the landscape, natural resources, and biodiversity present
  within the community; and
* Political capital—the ability of people and groups within the community to
  influence and control decision making regarding the other assets of the
  community. (Cornelia Butler Flora and Jan L. Flora, Rural Communities: Legacy
  and Change, 2004, p. 9-10.)

Rural communities like ours rarely take stock of these assets in any systematic
way to see what they have and how they are utilizing the assets they have. We
tend to focus on one or the other and perceive the limitations we might have.
But the question is how well we are utilizing all these various types of capital
for the welfare of the community as a whole.

For instance, we might recognize the limitations of our financial capital, but
fail to realize and utilize the social and human and natural capital that exists
within our community. We have often allowed our natural capital to be defined
almost exclusively in terms of the dominant paradigm of commodity agriculture
when in fact the natural capital of this area may be largely unexplored in terms
of its potential benefit to our community.

In this community, we may do fairly well at appreciating and capitalizing on our
cultural capital, but perhaps we struggle in translating that strong cultural
heritage into political capital capable of influencing decision-making and the
exercise of power.

Perhaps we need to take a closer look at the assets we have and in that way
build and utilize all the forms of capital present in this rural community. This
community does not have to keep declining, and we are capable of regaining the
political capital that will enable us to make the decisions required for a
sustainable community life.
