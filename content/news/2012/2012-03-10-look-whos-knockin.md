A readerâ€™s theatre production of the play Look Who's Knockin' by Doug Nopar will be presented at the Freeman Community
Center on Tuesday, April 10 at 7:30pm. The play will be presented by Phyllis Schrag and Jim Graber in the roles of
Nettie and Gerald, a retiring farm couple trying to decide the future of their farm.

The play raises questions of land ethics and the moral dilemma posed by wanting to get top dollar for selling one's land
while desiring to help the next generation of farmers get started farming.

See the [Land Stewardship Project's page][1] for more information and background on the play and links to podcasts.

This performance and discussion is sponsored by Rural Revival.
