Turning onto the gravel driveway one's eyes immediately gravitate to the roof of the two story house. Twenty four solar
panels cover the south side of the house and attached garage, which were installed eight years ago. In addition there
are many south facing windows to catch the low angle of the winter sun . The back of the bottom story faces north and is
buried in dirt for insulation.

East of the house stands a 7500 watt wind turbine atop a 100 foot tower. It was erected 11 years ago and is hinged near
the base for easy maintenance access.

Priscilla and Dennis Jurkovich moved from Colorado to the countryside near Dolton, SD in 2006 and have been at their
present location since 2008. Priscilla has a previous connection to Freeman when her parents relocated there. Her father
was pastor at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in the 1970's while she was away at college.

Dennis and Priscilla were high school sweethearts in Cleveland, Ohio. They have two children and five grandchildren.
Dennis used to work for IBM as an engineer writing computer software and is now retired. Priscilla is an RN. Her latest
job was working at Sanford's integrated health program. She continues to be on an active call list to see patients and
teach classes.

Entering the bottom story of their house led to a room containing 12 large batteries which are hooked up to the wind
generator and solar panels. An inverter allows the use of electrical appliances. Dennis says the wind and sun meet
approximately 60% of their electrical needs. They are also hooked up to the grid for backup electricity and use propane
for winter heat.

Dennis shared some thoughts about what motivates them to seek alternative energy. Dennis talked about having a degree of
self-reliance and food insurance. Many farmers have gasoline generators for backup power when the electric grid is down.
Wind and solar are another type of generator that does not need gasoline. The people of Texas found out the importance
of backup power this past winter. Many lost the food in their freezers when the electricity was off for days. The
Jurkovich's have solar and wind to protect them during power outages, to protect their food supply and keep them warm in
cold weather. Dennis sees solar and wind as a type of investment like farm land. Both take a long time to recover the
initial investment. Unlike farm land which has a yearly tax cost, solar and wind have tax benefits. Currently federal
income tax rules allow a 22% tax credit for the costs of installing wind or solar. This is a tax credit not a tax
deduction which can be carried over multiple years. A farmer who has had a good year could invest in wind or solar and
subtract 22% of the cost from his income tax. The renewable energy 22% credit expires this year unless Congress
extendeds it. Also, South Dakota will not increase your property tax for improving your property by installing wind and
solar.

One nice feature about solar power is that you can start small and build up. Home Depot has various size kits to get
started. A kit can be sized to run one appliance or to charge a phone or computer. After getting comfortable with solar,
the system can be expanded.

Of course the Jurkovich's have shelter belts north and west of the house, plus a large garden and 18 chickens for eggs
and to keep the grasshoppers under control. One year ago Dennis started 3 bee hives which quickly became four when one
hive swarmed. The couple love watching the increased activity of the bees as the weather warms. Now that the dandelions
are blooming their pollen sacs are loaded with rich orange pollen as they enter the hives.

The Jurkovich's are both Master Gardeners and Priscilla writes a monthly column on herbs for the Minnehaha Master
Gardens newsletter. Yes, she does have an herb garden and makes tinctures for medicinal and healthy living use. I got to
sample some of her homemade kombucha. She bottles the drink which is made from different fruits. It can have a mild or
strong vinegar taste and is naturally fizzy. The mulberry kombucha was very tasty, made from the trees they planted in
their shelter belt.

Dennis and Priscilla stand out as unique people as you drive past their place. Their self reliance extends from the
obvious solar panels and wind generator, to their chickens, bee hives, garden, wind breaks, fruit trees and passive
solar house.

Any visitor will come away richer with the knowledge they generously share.
