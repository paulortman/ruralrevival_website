"Rural Revival" exists on the web.

While not exactly a first for human kind, it is always a little bit of a feat for agriculturalists to find the time to
pause long enough to explain to others what we do, what we believe and what we see in the future. This website is but
one of those communication channels the group hopes to open up with the local community of rural Freeman, South Dakota
and beyond.

It's probably wise to at least initially point out our group's [Mission Statement][1] so all could see why we exist, and
likewise, you'll probably want to also know what broad [goals][2] and projects we see ourselves undertaking.

As for this website/blog, we hope that it will allow others to get information about us and help us in the coordination
of activities and education. We&#8217;ll likely be posting somewhat irregularly with bits of news we feel should be
shared and that pertain to our mission and goals.
