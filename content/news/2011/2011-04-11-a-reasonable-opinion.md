In March, Mark Bittman of the New York Times has an opinion piece, [Sustainable Farming Can Feed the World?][1] that
I thought nicely captured a fairly pragmatic, yet in many ways revolutionary view of agriculture that more and more
people are coming around to understand, acknowledge and support.

It certainly helps the legitimacy of an organization like _Rural Revival_ when official UN reports on agriculture
acknowledge and advocate for the sustainable development of local food markets around the world. Read [the article][1]
yourself, or jump straight the to the heady [UN report][2] directly. It may, at least, provide some food for thought â€“
pun intended.
