It's worth noting that on April 18th at noon, Dr. Mike Brown will be presenting an informative overview of modern
aquaculture. The presentation will take place at the Freeman Community Library at 12pm and should run between 1 and 2
hours depending on question and answer sessions, etc. The public is welcome, but space is limited and thus limited
publicity has been put forth.

The presentation will cover a swath of issues, but will likely have some focus on how fish farming could possibly apply
to rural Freeman, SD â€” not exactly the place you might think of when it comes to fish. One of the more interesting
topics, is how a number of communities have converted [old hog confinement buildings to aquaculture][1]. Likewise there
will be discussion on [aquaponics][2], along with newer breeds of fish as least some of which are [genetically
engineered for concentrated farming][3].
