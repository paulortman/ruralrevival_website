Last August, Dick Thompson of Boone, Iowa, died. Thompson was an “alternative
farmer” before that came to be a common thing, as it is today. A founder of
Practical Farmers of Iowa, Thompson and his wife Sharon believed strongly that a
healthy agriculture/rural community involves an integrated system of land,
crops, livestock and family. I remember him speaking at rural life conferences
in Iowa during the farm crisis of the 1970s, though it isn’t clear to me that
that crisis has ever stopped.

In honor of Thompson’s life, the Leopold Letter, the newsletter of the Leopold
Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University in Ames, reprinted a
short piece Thompson wrote in 2004, and I’d like to quote from that too.

> Since we lost the cow—since we lost animals and livestock as an integrated part

> When we lost the cow, we stopped planting oats and hay, we lost our crop

> a less diverse and resilient landscape.

> When we lost the balance of crops and livestock, we lost a farm that needed a

We are fortunate to live in a landscape that counters and mitigates to some
extent the agricultural imbalances Thompson describes in this quote. The rivers
and creeks of our larger community—the Vermillion and James rivers, Wolf and
Turkey Ridge creeks, and Turkey Ridge itself, require diversified farming in
many areas and for many farmers—a balance of crops and livestock, in order to
utilize the often rolling hills and bluffs with their pastures and hay fields.

Yet it seems to me that our community too is suffering from the imbalances
Thompson describes.

An integrated agricultural landscape is to me a thing of beauty. In contrast to
the barrenness of endless corn and soybean fields with the occasional hog or
poultry confinement unit or beef feedlot, a balanced agricultural landscape
features a patchwork of livestock roaming on a rotation of small, diverse fields
supporting many small farm families all involved in the production of food for
their own community and nearby urban centers.

But more than being nostalgically beautiful, an integrated agricultural
landscape is the key for guaranteeing sustainable and viable rural communities
like Freeman. Nature is built on the principles of diversity, uniqueness and
interdependence. Industry thrives on efficiency, uniformity and autonomy.
Agriculture is torn between nature and industry, with industry currently having
the upper hand. Until nature replaces industry as the paradigm for agriculture,
rural communities like Freeman are likely to continue to struggle and decline.
