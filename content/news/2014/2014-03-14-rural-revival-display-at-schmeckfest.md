This year, Rural Revival will again have a display table at Schmeckfest. This
year, the display will be in the Heritage Hall Museum building instead of
Sterling Hall as in years past. All are encouraged to visit the display to learn
more about Rural Revival. Local producers will also have information at the
table. The theme of this year's display is Beekeeping, and there will be an
informative video playing during the festival. Glen Wollman, a local beekeeper
and member of Rural Revival will be in charge of the display.

Schmeckfest is a cultural heritage festival benefiting the Freeman Academy in
Freeman, SD. The dates this year are March 21-22, and March 28-29. For more
information on the festival, such as hours, directions, other attractions, or
