Though we obviously have embraced the web for communication and organization, we also believe that communication best happens when you are face to face.  Given that we are concerned about local issues, the main stakeholders all are, in fact, local making face-to-face meetings possible. If you would like to attend any of our meetings, they are open to all and we welcome your attendance (sometimes we even have food!).

Our meetings are regularly scheduled for the 4th Monday evening of each month and are held in the Freeman Public Library meeting room at 8pm.  Please feel free to attend, we welcome your input into the process.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us][1].
